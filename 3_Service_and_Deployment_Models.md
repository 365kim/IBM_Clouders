- __Infrastructure-as-a-Service__
    - delivers fundamental compute, network, and storage resources to consumers on-demand
    - customers can create or provision virtual machines in their choice of Region and Zone available from the Cloud Provider.<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60066472/85106993-27012f80-b248-11ea-8a34-e31a4b6d435a.PNG" width="400"></p>
- __Key Components__
    - Physical Data Centers: end experience it as a service provided to them.
    - Compute: auto-scaling and load balancing
    - Network
    - Storage: object, file, block
- __Use Cases__
    - for Test and Development
    - for Business Continuity and Disaster REcovery
    - for Faster Depoloyments and Scaling
    - for High Performance Computing
    - for Big Data Anlaysis
- __Concerns__: lack of transparency, dependency on a third party

- __Platform-as-a-Service__
    - provides customers a complete platform—hardware, software, and infrastructure—to develop, deploy, manage, and run applications created by them or acquired from a third-party.
    - hosts everything—servers, networks, storage, operating system, application runtimes, APIs, middleware, databases, and other tools—at their data center.
    - leaves the user responsible for only the application code and its maintenance.
- __Essential Characteristics__
    - High level of Abstraction
    - Supprt Services and APIs
    - Run-time Environments
    - Rapid Deployment Mechanism
    - Middleware Capabilities
- __Use Cases__
    - for API Developments and Management
    - for IoT
    - for Business Analytics/Intelligence
    - for Business Process Management
    - for Master Data Management
- __Available Offerings__
    - Cloud Foundry, IBM Cloud Paks, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Windows Azure, RedHat OpenShift, Magento Commerce
Cloud, Force.com, and Apache Stratos.
- __Advantages__: Scalability, Faster time to market, Greater agility and innovation
- __Concerns__: Information security threats, Dependency on service provider's infrastructure.

## :cloud: Module Summary
- Cloud computing allows us to utilize technology as a service, leveraging remote resources on-demand, on a pay-as-you-model. There are three main service models available on the cloud—Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).
    - IaaS provides the fundamental compute, network, and storage resources for customers on-demand.
    - PaaS provides customers the hardware, software, and infrastructure to develop, deploy, manage, and run applications created by them or acquired from a third-party.
    - SaaS provides access to users to a service provider’s cloud-based software. Users simply access the applications on Cloud while the Cloud provider maintains the infrastructure, platform, data, application code, security, availability, and performance of the application.
- Deployment models indicate where the infrastructure resides, who owns and manages it, and how cloud resources and services are made available to users. There are three main deployment models available on the cloud—Public, Private, and Hybrid.
    - In the Public cloud model, the service provider owns, manages, provisions, and maintains the physical infrastructure such as data centers, servers, networking equipment, and storage, with users accessing virtualized compute, networking, and storage resources as services.
    - In the Private cloud model, the provider provisions the cloud infrastructure for exclusive use by a single organization. The private cloud infrastructure can be internal to the organization and run or on-premises. Or, it can be on a public cloud, as in the case of Virtual Private Clouds (VPC) and be owned, managed, and operated by the cloud provider.
    - In the Hybrid cloud model, an organization’s on-premise private cloud and third-party, public cloud is connected as a single, flexible infrastructure leveraging the features and benefits of both Public and Private clouds.
