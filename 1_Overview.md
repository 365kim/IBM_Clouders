## :cloud: Module Summary
- Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing resources over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis; <br>resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned among multiple users and scale up and down in response to users’ needs.
- The origins of cloud computing can be traced back to the mainframes of the 1950s, with virtualization technologies and hypervisors serving as catalysts for the emergence of modern-day cloud computing.
- Organizations must consider their business needs, investment viability, and risk capacity in order to create a cloud adoption strategy that delivers desired benefits without causing business disruptions and security, compliance, or performance issues.
- Cloud adoption is growing faster than predicted. Driving this technological wave are cloud service providers with a host of services ranging from Infrastructure, Platform, and Software services.
- Some major Cloud providers of our times include AWS, Alibaba Cloud, Google, IBM Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.

## :cloud: Graded Quiz
- In the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, definition of "cloud computing", what does the statement "shared pool of configurable computing resources" include?
  ```
  ▷ Five essential characteristics, three deployment models, three service models
  ▷ Data security, associated with loss or unavailability of data causing business disruption
  ▷ Leverage cloud services over the open internet on hardware owned by the cloud provider
  ▶ Networks, servers, storage, applications, and services
  ```
- What tasks do hypervisors accomplish? Select two.
  ```
  ▶ Enable multiple operating systems to run alongside each other, sharing the same physical computing resources.
  ▷ Facilitate access to mainframes for multiple users to access the same data storage layer.
  ▷ Scale on demand to support fluctuating workloads.
  ▶ Separates VMs logically and assigns each a share of the underlying computing power, memory, and storage.
  ```
- What are some of the cloud benefits that make it lower risk for enterprises to adopt cloud? Select two.
  ```
  ▷ Data security associated with loss or unavailability of data causing business disruption
  ▶ The pay-as-you-go model allows enterprises to experiment with technologies as opposed to making long-term decisions based on little or no trial.
  ▷ Diversity of standardization in how the constantly evolving technologies integrate and interoperate.
  ▶ The speed with which applications can be up and running on the cloud versus months on traditional platforms, means enterprises can experiment, fail fast, learn, and course correct without setting them back significantly.
  ```
