    ```

1. Which of these are essential characteristics of the Cloud? Select two.
    ```
    ▷ Single-tenant
    ▶ On-demand self-service
    ▶ Resource pooling
    ▷ Fixed fee
    ```

1. What are some cloud computing benefits? Select two.
    ```
    ▷ Purchasing off-the-shelf software and upgrades
    ▷ Diversity of standardization in how the constantly evolving technologies integrate and interoperate.
    ▶ Competitive advantage
    ▶ Flexibility and efficiency
    ```

1. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC), what is that crucial ability that will make cloud computing essential for businesses to succeed, sustain, and compete in today’s markets?
    ```
    ▷ Multi-cloud infrastructures
    ▶ Data-driven decisions
    ▷ Cognitively-enabled workflows
    ▷ Applied exponential technologies such as AI, Automation, IoT, and Blockchain
    ```

1. IoT, AI, Blockchain, and Analytics are emerging technologies enabled by the cloud. What are some of the attributes of cloud computing that enable these technologies? Select two.
    ```
    ▷ Cloud resources are offered in a single-tenant model
    ▶ The power and scale of cloud resources
    ▷ Computing resources can be accessed via internet connection
    ▶ Cloud offers on-demand computing
    ```

1. In the car analogy used to explain the differences between the three cloud service models, which of the provided options is an analogy for PaaS?
    ```
    ▷ Buying a car
    ▷ Hiring a taxi
    ▷ Leasing a car
    ▶ Renting a car
    ```

1. Which of these scenarios are good use cases for Public Cloud? Select two.
    ```
    ▶ Reducing time-to-market for products and services
    ▷ Managing business critical platforms and applications
    ▶ Disaster recovery, data protection, and business continuity
    ▷ Applications with stable capacity and resourcing needs
    ```

1. Private cloud platforms can be implemented internally or externally. What is an example of external private cloud platform?
    ```
    ▷ Controlled access and customized security measures
    ▶ Virtual Private Cloud or VPC
    ▷ Platform that is owned, managed, and operated by the organization
    ▷ Cloud platform that runs on-premises
    ```

1. The infrastructure layer is the foundation of the cloud and consists of physical resources. Where do these physical resources reside?
    ```
    ▷ In a warehouse that houses a centralized mainframe server
    ▶ Regions, Zones, and Data Centers
    ▷ Virtual Servers, Bare Metal Servers, and Serverless computing resources
    ▷ Compute, Storage, and Networking Resources
    ```

1. Why do bare metal servers take longer to provision than virtual servers?
    ```
    ▷ They're multi-tenant servers, and all tenants must help configure them
    ▷ Customer configures the physical servers
    ▷ GPUs for data analytics are hard to configure and provision
    ▶ They are physical servers that can be customized to specified capacity
    ```

1. Containers provide isolation of applications. What is one of the benefits this provides?
    ```
    ▷ Open sourced runtime engine
    ▷ Repackaged into containers or containerized microservices
    ▷ Abstraction from the host operating system
    ▶ Help keep malicious code in one container from impacting other containers
    ```

1. What makes File storage an ideal solution for scenarios where common storage (a landing zone for incoming files) is needed?
    ```
    ▷ File Storage is mounted to compute nodes via an ethernet network
    ▷ Its consistently high speed
    ▶ File storage can be mounted to multiple compute nodes at a time
    ▷ Mounted from remote storage appliances
    ```

1. Which of these scenarios are best suited for Block Storage? Select two.
    ```
    ▶ Workloads that need low-latency storage
    ▷ Workloads that need disk sharing between compute nodes
    ▷ Low cost is a consideration
    ▶ Applications that need consistent fast access to disk, such as databases
    ```

1. Which of the following is NOT a good fit for Object Storage?
    ```         
    ▷ Files or objects that are static
    ▷ Data that does not require fast read and write speeds
    ▶ Operating systems or applications like databases
    ▷ Storage needs are finite and can be pre-defined
    ```

1. What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?
    ```
    ▶ A distributed server network
    ▷ A network link
    ▷ Network topology
    ▷ A network node
    ```

1. What are some of the benefits of using microservices architecture? Select two.
    ```
    ▶ Application components can be developed and updated independently of each other
    ▷ Each microservice of an application needs to use the same stack and runtime environment
    ▶ Components facing varied amounts of load can be scaled independently
    ▷ Each line of code for a microservice needs to be written from scratch
    ```

1. What are the characteristics of a cloud native application?
    ```
    ▶ Collection of microservices working together as a whole to comprise an application
    ▷ Collection of microservices with tightly coupled UI, business logic layer, and data layer
    ▷ Collection of microservices that need to be scaled and updated in relation to each other
    ▷ Collection of microservices that are built as one huge piece of software
    ```

1. DevOps’ tools, practices, and processes are helping tackle some of the complexities and challenges posed by the cloud. Identify two ways in which DevOps is mitigating these challenges. Select two.
    ```
    ▷ DevOps processes outline the development principles that need to be followed to modernize monolithic applications to cloud native applications
    ▶ By creating an automated deployment pipeline
    ▶ By fully automating the infrastructure installation process in a way that is documented, repeatable, verifiable, and traceable
    ▷ DevOps best practices eliminate the need to provision servers, build middleware, and install application code
    ```
